# Complete Lab Environement Setup
The lab environment begins with much of the software pre-installed. For each lab you may need to perform a few steps to complete the lab set-up before beginning to learn about the topics in this lab.
1. To experience how you can click here to run a command in the command shell, click this highlighted command: `echo "I just ran this echo command"'{{execute}}
2. Run the lab setup script for this lab; note that it will take a few seconds to complete: `/opt/configure-environment.sh`{{execute}}
3. this is yet another step
4. This is a command: `pwd`{{execute}}
5. I will now echo something: `echo "Run in Terminal"`{{execute}}
6. This is Wendell typing with weird single quote `pwd`{{execute}}
