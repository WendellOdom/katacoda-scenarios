1. Ensure you are in the ~/netauto/ansible-course-01 directory using the `pwd`{{execute}} and `cd ~/netauto/ansible-course-01`{{execute}} commands.
2. Copy this command to the clipboard: `more ansible-hosts.ini`{{copy}}
3. Paste the command into the terminal and press enter to view the contents of the **ansible-hosts.ini** file. 
4. Open the file in the Kata text editor by clicking the highlighted item. This one uses ./ansible-course-01/ansible-hosts.ini, after setting   "uieditorpath": "/root/netauto": `./ansible-course-01/ansible-hosts.ini`{{open}}
5. This attempt has the full path of root/netauto/ansible-course-01/ansible-hosts.ini: `root/netauto/ansible-course-01/ansible-hosts.ini`{{open}}
6. Look around the file and close it in the GUI by clicking (whatever)
