# Introduction

This lab defines Wendell's lab template. To create a new lab, Wendell copies the files in this folder and renames the folder to create the lab. After a git push, and a few minutes, the new lab appears on the katacoda.com site.

The Lab Pages for this Lab are:

1. Discover the Lab Environment
2. How to Use {{execute}} and Similar
3. Working with Files in the Shell and Kata Editor
4. Embedding Images and Videos
5. Embedding Code into the Lab Markdown
6. A Page of Examples from the Katacoda.com Markdown Examples
